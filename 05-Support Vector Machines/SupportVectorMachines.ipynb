    "Given a dataset, the algorithm tries to divide the data using hyperplanes and then makes the predictions. SVM is a non-probabilistic linear classifier. While other classifiers, when classifying, predict the probability of a data point to belong to one group or the another, SVM directly says to which group the datapoint belongs to without using any probability calculation.\n"

    "- SVM constructs a best line or the decision boundary called **Hyperplane** which can be used for classification or regression or outlier detection.  The dimension of the hyperplane depends upon the number of features. If the number of input features is 2, then the hyperplane is just a line. If the number of input features is 3, then the hyperplane becomes a two-dimensional plane.\n",
    "\n",
    "- This hyperplane creates 2 margin lines parallel to it which have some distance so that it can distinctly classify the data points. The distance between the 2 margin lines are called **marginal distance**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- These 2 margin lines passes through the most nearest +ve points and the most nearest -ve points. Those points through which the margin lines pass are called **support vectors**. Support vectors are important as it helps to determine the maximum distance of the marginal plane.\n",

Hence hyperplane with the maximum marginal distance is considered to be the best hyperplane.\n",

But the introduction of new dimensions makes the computations for the SVMs more intensive, which impacts the algorithm performance. To rectify this, mathematicians came up with the approach of Kernel methods. \n",
    "Kernel methods use kernel functions available in mathematics. The unique feature of a kernel function is to compute in a higher-dimensional space without calculating the new coordinates in that higher dimension. It implicitly uses predefined mathematical functions to do operations on the existing points which mimic the computation in a higher-dimensional space without adding to the computation cost as they are not actually calculating the coordinates in the higher dimension thereby avoiding the computation of calculating distances from the newly computed points.  This is called the kernel trick.\n",
